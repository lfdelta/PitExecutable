1. replaced place_meeting with position_meeting for hookshotSuccess, so that it only checks the mouse position
	rather than accounting for the shape of the player's hitbox. this corrected the grapple detection errors
2. implemented variable jump height (must hold key down to reach max height)
3. room changes; renamed Demo Room and added more chunks of obj_wall tiles
4. created obj_anchor. for testing purposes, they are orange; for play, we can set the draw event to do nothing
5. implemented a simple anchor generator: anchors are placed on top of obj_player_collide objects which are not
	surrounded on all four sides. a /slightly/ more advanced algorithm would place vertical and horizontal
	strips of vertical and horizontal obj_anchor children objects only on the faces which are exposed.
	** be careful when placing tiles, as two walls placed atop one another will intersect in all directions
	   and hence will not produce an anchor even if one should appear there
6. generalized grappleSpeed = 5 as a variable under obj_player
