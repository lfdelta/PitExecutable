1. trimmed spr_player canvas to make the collision box symmetric about center
2. implemented grappleState in place of hookshotSuccess
3. enforced grappleState locking to approach desired hookshot behavior

1. reproduced the ternary operator in a script formed as IF(bool, expr1, expr2)
2. adapted an old algorithm to draw pixel-perfect lines as a means to produce adaptive, angle-based collisions.
   after some wrestling and debugging, it APPEARS to work perfectly, with one exception: the player sticks to
   horizontal surfaces when pushing into them (this should not be a difficult fix)

1. edited grappling and drawing mechanisms to use a ray cast rather than just the mouse position. this allows
	the player to click in any direction at any distance, and the cast will follow the line from player
	center to mouse position as far as grappleReach allows, then grapple to the anchor on that line which
	falls nearest to the player
2. increased grappleReach and grappleSpeed significantly

1. replaced place_meeting with position_meeting for hookshotSuccess, so that it only checks the mouse position
	rather than accounting for the shape of the player's hitbox. this corrected the grapple detection errors
2. implemented variable jump height (must hold key down to reach max height)
3. room changes; renamed Demo Room and added more chunks of obj_wall tiles
4. created obj_anchor. for testing purposes, they are orange; for play, we can set the draw event to do nothing
5. implemented a simple anchor generator: anchors are placed on top of obj_player_collide objects which are not
	surrounded on all four sides. a /slightly/ more advanced algorithm would place vertical and horizontal
	strips of vertical and horizontal obj_anchor children objects only on the faces which are exposed.
	** be careful when placing tiles, as two walls placed atop one another will intersect in all directions
	   and hence will not produce an anchor even if one should appear there
6. generalized grappleSpeed = 5 as a variable under obj_player
