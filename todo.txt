
* correct player sprite symmetry so that the player can't enter walls by standing next to them while facing away,
	then moving the mouse to the other side of the player, which rotates the sprite until they clip with the wall
* make it so the player only grapples with anchors if there is nothing else between the player and the anchor
* experiment with gravity and player control during grapple; this may require implementing an acceleration
	or pseudo-force rather than directly setting the player velocity when grappling
